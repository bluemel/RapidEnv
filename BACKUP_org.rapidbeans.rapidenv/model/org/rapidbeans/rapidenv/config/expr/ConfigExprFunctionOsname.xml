	<description>Determine the operating system (family) name of the underlying node.
Currently the following operating systems (families) are recognized:
linux, windows, mac</description>

		<description>Maps certain operating system (family) names to other strings.
The map is specified the following way: &amp;lt;osname&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;mapped packaging&amp;gt; [,&amp;lt;osname&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;mapped pckaging&amp;gt;] ...
e.g. the expression "eclipse-modeling-indigo-''osname('windows=win32,linux=linux-gtk')''architecture('x86=,i386=;x86_64=-x86_64').packaging()"
will result into following mappings:
