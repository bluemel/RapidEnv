<beantype name="org.rapidbeans.rapidenv.config.Project">
	<description>The root object for every project environment defined
by means of RapidEnv.</description>

	<property name="name" type="string" mandatory="true">
		<description>The development environment project name</description>
	</property>

	<property name="tag" type="string" default="main">
		<description>The tag specifies an ID which together with the project name
uniquely identifies a development environment on your machine.
Since you usually only have more than one development environment
concerning the same project on your machine in case you have to
work with different branches in parellel this tag will usually
specify the branch (e. g. "main"). but it's also possible to work with
two different local development environments on the same branch.
In this case the tag value has to be specified differently
(e. g. "main_a" and main_b").</description>

	<property name="installsourceurl" type="string"
		propclass="org.rapidbeans.rapidenv.config.PropertyInterpretedString">
		<description>The URL where all installation unit packages are taken from

it automatically defaults to &lt;installsourceurl&gt;/&lt;installunit.space&gt;/&lt;installunit.name&gt;/&lt;installunit.version&gt;
whereas each component of "installunit.space" will become a separate subfolder. 
Otherwise install units define their specific source URL.
This property is not mandatory but you are supposed to
ether specify a value for it
or to specify "sourceurl" for all the project's installunits.</description>

whereas each component of "space" will become a separate subfolder. 
Otherwise install units define their specific home directory.
This property is not mandatory but you are supposed to
