	<description>An ant task command configuration allows you to define
		the execution of an arbitrary Ant task with an arbitrary set of
		named arguments. Like with commands you could check preconditions on files
		if the ant task has to be executed. Postconditions on the return code,
		stdout and stderror as well as on files can be used to verify
		ant task execution success.</description>
