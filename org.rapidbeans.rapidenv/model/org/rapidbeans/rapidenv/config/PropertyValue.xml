	<description>A specific value definition for a RapidEnv property
This specific value definition overrides the parent property's value attribute
for two purposes:
1) platform (os) specific value definitions
2) complex value definitions that can't be performed in an XML attribute and need an
   XML element</description>
	<property name="osfamily" type="choice"
		enum="org.rapidbeans.core.util.OperatingSystem">
		<description>If this value is defined the environment variable becomes a platform specific one.
If it is undefined the definition the property's value is valid for all platforms.</description>

		<description>The property's (default) value.
Could be platform specific when using the "osfamily" attribute.
