<beantype name="org.rapidbeans.rapidenv.config.Include">

	<description>A pseudo configuration element to include other files containing parts
of a project (environment) definition.
Splitting up a project definition in different files has two advantages:
1) It simply improves the structure and maintainability of a large environment definition.
2) Partial project definitions might be reused in different environment definitions.
Include elements are processed in advance and put together into one single big XML document
by a fuzzy RapidEnv preprocessor. Please note you must write the whole include XML element
in one single line in order to be processed correctly. Another pseudo element &lt;projectpart&gt;
will serve as the root element for partial definitions however with the current DTD
approach &lt;installunit&gt; is a syntactically valid root element as well.</description>

	<property name="file" type="string">
		<description>A relative or absolute path to the file to be included
(e. g. &lt;include file="../inc/envincl.xml"/&gt;).</description>
	</property>

	<codegen mode="simple"/>
