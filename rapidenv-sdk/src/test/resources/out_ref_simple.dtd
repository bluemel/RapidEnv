<!-- Element: project
	The root object for every project environment defined
	by means of RapidEnv.
	Attribute: name
		The development environment project name
	Attribute: tag
		The tag specifies an ID which together with the project name
		uniquely identifies a development environment on your machine.
		Since you usually only have more than one development environment
		concerning the same project on your machine in case you have to
		work with different branches in parellel this tag will usually
		specify the branch (e. g. "main"). but it's also possible to work with
		two different local development environments on the same branch.
		In this case the tag value has to be specified differently
		(e. g. "main_a" and main_b").
	Attribute: installsourceurl
		The URL where all installation unit packages are taken from
		by default. If an installunit's "sourceurl" is not defined
		it automatically defaults to <installsourceurl>/<installunit.space>/<installunit.name>/<installunit.version>
		whereas each component of "installunit.space" will become a separate subfolder. 
		Otherwise install units define their specific source URL.
		This property is not mandatory but you are supposed to
		ether specify a value for it
		or to specify "sourceurl" for all the project's installunits.
	Attribute: installtargetdir
		The relative or absolute path to the local folder where all install units are installed to by default.
		If an installunit's "homedir" is not defined the "homedir" automatically defaults to
		<installtargetdir>/<installunit.space>/<installunit.name>/<installunit.version>
		whereas each component of "space" will become a separate subfolder. 
		Otherwise install units define their specific home directory.
		This property is not mandatory but you are supposed to
		ether specify a value for it
		or to specify a "homedir" for all the project's installunits.
	Attribute: profiledir
		The folder where all user profiles are located.
		By default this value is the folder where the renv command is located.
	Attribute: expressionLiteralEscaping
		Set this value to true if you want to use
